    "*Key Notes:*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A **program** is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation which can be something mathematical or symbolic computation\n",
    "2. Few basic **instructions** appeared in different languages\n",
    "   1. input - Get data\n",
    "   2. output - display data\n",
    "   3. math - perform basic mathematical operations\n",
    "   4. repetition - perform some actions repeatedly \n",
    "3. Python provides **operators** which are special symbols that represent computations such as addition and multiplication\n",
    "4. A **value** is one of the basic things a program works with, like a number or a letter\n",
    "   1. the values belong to different types such as integer <int>, float <float>, or string <str>\n",
    "5. Formal and Natural Language - \n",
    "   1. Natural language is the one which people speaks such as English, Spanish etc.\n",
    "   2. Formal language are languages that are designed by people for specific applications. \n",
    "      1. Formal languages tend to have strict **syntax** rules that govern the structure of the statements\n",
    "         1. The syntax comes in two ways : tokens and structure\n",
    "            1. **tokens** are the basic elements of the language such as words, numbers etc\n",
    "            2. The structure is how the tokens are combined \n",
    "         2. The process of identifying the structure of the language is called **parsing** "
